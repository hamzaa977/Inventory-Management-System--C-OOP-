Inventory management system 
Semester 2 Project 
    Fast Nuces PWR

  In this Project the file named accounts.txt is being used to store all the users credentials 
  whatever their user id and user password is , they all are getting stored in that file
  
  (basically file handling )  xD



->  How It Works:

At first the user need to signup or register for a new account afterwards the user need to signin 
so that he/she can use the inventory.

Furthermore in inventory he/she can ADD , REMOVE , UPDATE ,REVIEW and SEARCH for different products which 
he/she stored in inventory before.
